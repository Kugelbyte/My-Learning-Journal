### **November 2. 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Create a video for youtube and create my channel.

**What I Learned?**
* My video's theme was about a CTF Minmap to help beginners.
* Whole day went into creating a mindmap, then creating the script, editing the video and creating the channel.

**Thoughts**
* Content creation is not easy as it seems, huge respect to content creators.
* I went through my script a lot, rehearsed multiple times but then realized it is much more easier for me to have a conversation style of video rather than a pre-decided script.
* Discarded the script and recorded the video assuming that I was explaining to my younger self.
* Video is ready and scheduled to launch tomorrow November 3, 2025, it's not flawless but at least I tried and I will improve in further videos.
