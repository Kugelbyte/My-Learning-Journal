### **November 2. 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Create a video for youtube and create my channel.

**What I Learned?**
* My video's theme was about a CTF Minmap to help beginners.
* Whole day went into creating a mindmap, then creating the script, editing the video and creating the channel.

**Thoughts**
* Content creation is not easy as it seems, huge respect to content creators.
* I went through my script a lot, rehearsed multiple times but then realized it is much more easier for me to have a conversation style of video rather than a pre-decided script.
* Discarded the script and recorded the video assuming that I was explaining to my younger self.
* Video is ready and scheduled to launch tomorrow November 3, 2025, it's not flawless but at least I tried and I will improve in further videos.

### **November 3, 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Complete Information Gathering module of the eJPT training.

**What I Learned?** 
* Watched videos using Google Dorks for passive information gathering.
* Brushed up my knowledge on nmap and its different options.

**Thoughts**
* Google Dorks are really really good, I should start using them, they reveal a lot of information.

### **November 4, 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Attempt the Information Gathering lab of eJPT training material.
* Active recon in the VDP target.

**What I Learned/Did ?**
* The information gathering lab of the eJPT training module consists 5 objectives/flags, I found 4 of them, only 1 flag remains.
* Did some active recon again on VDP, this time I created an account on the target and tried for bypassing access controls, trying for IDORs.
* The target's security is robust they are implementing random GUIDs instead of usernames, multiple API calls are also involved. This is not going to be easy.

**Thoughts**
* I am slowly getting that feeling of "what if i do this?" while doing active recon on VDP target.
* There are still knowledge gaps which are preventing me from seeing the bigger picture, i need to address this by learning more concepts.

### **November 05, 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Continue with eJPT training.
* Learn more topics related to web security.

**What I Learned ?**
* Watched some eJPT training material on OSI model and nmap, I was already familiar with OSI model so breezed through that part.
* Learned some host discovery techniques in nmap and when to use them.
* After 12 PM started feeling drowsy and headache started so canceled the web security topics and instead read vulnerability disclosure reports by other bug hunters.

**Thoughts**
* I need to keep pushing everyday, that is the only way I am going to make it, only action can save me.
* After reading the reports of other hunters, I realized the techniques they used were not advanced and nothing out of my knowledgebase.
* I felt a bit hopeful, I will find the bug one day, just a matter of time.
