### **November 1, 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Refresh the basics of dns recon.

**What I Learned?**
* Completed some training material on dns reconnaissance in eJPT Training course.
* Got to know about Netcraft, another dns recon utility.

**Thoughts**
* Learned about "dnsdumpster", this really provides information in comprehensive manner.

### **November 2. 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Create a video for youtube and create my channel.

**What I Learned?**
* My video's theme was about a CTF Minmap to help beginners.
* Whole day went into creating a mindmap, then creating the script, editing the video and creating the channel.

**Thoughts**
* Content creation is not easy as it seems, huge respect to content creators.
* I went through my script a lot, rehearsed multiple times but then realized it is much more easier for me to have a conversation style of video rather than a pre-decided script.
* Discarded the script and recorded the video assuming that I was explaining to my younger self.
* Video is ready and scheduled to launch tomorrow November 3, 2025, it's not flawless but at least I tried and I will improve in further videos.

### **November 3, 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Complete Information Gathering module of the eJPT training.

**What I Learned?** 
* Watched videos using Google Dorks for passive information gathering.
* Brushed up my knowledge on nmap and its different options.

**Thoughts**
* Google Dorks are really really good, I should start using them, they reveal a lot of information.

### **November 4, 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Attempt the Information Gathering lab of eJPT training material.
* Active recon in the VDP target.

**What I Learned/Did ?**
* The information gathering lab of the eJPT training module consists 5 objectives/flags, I found 4 of them, only 1 flag remains.
* Did some active recon again on VDP, this time I created an account on the target and tried for bypassing access controls, trying for IDORs.
* The target's security is robust they are implementing random GUIDs instead of usernames, multiple API calls are also involved. This is not going to be easy.

**Thoughts**
* I am slowly getting that feeling of "what if i do this?" while doing active recon on VDP target.
* There are still knowledge gaps which are preventing me from seeing the bigger picture, i need to address this by learning more concepts.

### **November 05, 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Continue with eJPT training.
* Learn more topics related to web security.

**What I Learned ?**
* Watched some eJPT training material on OSI model and nmap, I was already familiar with OSI model so breezed through that part.
* Learned some host discovery techniques in nmap and when to use them.
* After 12 PM started feeling drowsy and headache started so canceled the web security topics and instead read vulnerability disclosure reports by other bug hunters.

**Thoughts**
* I need to keep pushing everyday, that is the only way I am going to make it, only action can save me.
* After reading the reports of other hunters, I realized the techniques they used were not advanced and nothing out of my knowledgebase.
* I felt a bit hopeful, I will find the bug one day, just a matter of time.

### **November 06, 2025**

**Today' Focus**
* Cover more nmap concepts from eJPT training.
* Learn concepts from Portswigger Academy.

**What I Learned / Did ?**
* Explored various types of scans in nmap and when to use them, such as SYN scan, ACK scan.
* Read some basic information on JWT authentication.
* Read some more reports of other hunters on SQLi.

**Thoughts**
* Today I felt a loss of energy in noon so pivoted to some report reading.
* SQL injections mentioned in those reports were found simply by running sqlmap, this gives me hope that it's not that difficult, I need to be thorough on my concepts.

### **November 07, 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Explore nmap scripting engine from eJPT training material and firewall/IDS evasion techniques.
* Setup Kali Linux on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

**What I Did ?**
* Learned about nmap scripting engine and various types of scripts used for enumeration/information gathering.
* Learned about different options in nmap which can be used for firewall and IDS evasion such as fragmentation, delaying the packets.
* Set up Kali Linux on WSL and configured Kex (Kali Linux GUI for WSL).

**Thoughts**
* Although I am already experienced with nmap but today i delved into some advanced topics (firewall evasion) which was great.
* Setting up Kali on WSL took longer than expected (took my whole second half of the day).
* Finally Kali is running smooth and lag free contrary to Kali VM, I hope this will increase my productivity from now on as that horrible lag on kali vm really used to annoy me.

### **November 08, 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Try to solve a challenge from hackthebox.
* Record video for youtube.

**What I Did ?**
* Started the day with jumping into hackthebox, picked up a challenge.
* This challenge introduced  me to a new concept, XLST Injection.
* I wasn't able to solve the challenge as I lacked the necessary knowledge, but i will delve more into XLST injection and attempt the challenge later.
* Recorded a video on ffuf, I did a simple demonstration of tool, showing how to fuzz and filter out results.

**Thoughts**
* XLST Injection doesn't seemed that complicated but I think I need to have a thorough understanding of XML and XXE Injection atleast at basic level.
* This time I recorded the video in parts and then combined it into whole.

### **November 09, 2025**

**Today's Focus**
* Upload the video to youtube.
* Watch a video from eJPT training material.

**What I Did ?**
* Uploaded the video recorded yesterday on youtube.
* Watched a video on how to output the nmap scan results in text files.

**Thoughts**
* Going to Indore tonight, tomorrow I will try to explore to new OWASP 2025.
