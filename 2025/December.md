**Today's Focus**
* Solve 2 labs from eJPT training course.
* Attempt a ctf challenge on tryhackme.

**What I Learned/Did ?**
* I solved two ctf labs from eJPT training course.
* These labs were based on exploiting vulnerabilites and services like ssh, webdav, samba, shellshock.
* Escalated privileges using suid binaries.
* Attempted a lab on tryhackme, exploited sql injection using sqlmap and dumped the database.
* Database dump revealed the ssh credentials. Gained initital access using the credentials.

**Thoughts**
* Attemptin the tryhackme me after so long felt refreshing.
